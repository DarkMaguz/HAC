# HAC
### Hash Algorithm Collider

This is an old project of mine created to test a hash algorithm I created for fun back in the mid 00’s playing around with C/C++ mainly as an exorcise in creating multithreaded network applications. The hash algorithm it self is an 1684 bit hash algorithm with cryptographic properties, but is not to be taken seriously.

The server app it self has been dockerized, so it’s easy to run.

### Plans for the future
* Create a web interface for statistics.
* Separate the algorithm from the client/server, so that this project can be used for other purposes.
